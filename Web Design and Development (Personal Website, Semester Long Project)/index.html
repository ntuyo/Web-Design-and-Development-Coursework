<h1>A Brief Overview of Me</h1>
<div class="boxed">
<!-- First Paragraph-->
<p>I'm Nazari, <!-- add some descriptive things here --> an 11th grader at CRLS.
    I have a little brother who's 10. I've lived in Cambridge my whole life, and I really like it here.
    I love to hang out with friends, and hang out with my family as well.
</p>

<div class="boxed">
    <p>
    I have taken AP CSP and AP CS as far as computer science classes in high school.
    <br> My love for CS began when I was about 9 years old. My dad bought a raspberry pi for
    me, and at first I hated it.
    <br> I especially hated python. I still dislike it to this day. </p>
<!-- Second Paragraph-->
<p>After a few years of scratch, a started to program in java script on khan academy.
    <br> I stopped for a while, but resumed cs last year in AP CSP.
    <br> Some other things that I've experienced
    are traveling to about 6 different Asian countries, and spending lots of time with my family. </p>

<h2>My Future Career</h2>
<div class="boxed">
<p> I would like to go to college at either mit or boston university. I want to major in software
    development, and minor in mechanical engineering.
    <br> I really enjoy building electronics, so an alternate to a programming job would be to build
    and design gadgets.
    <br> If I don't go into engineering, I would love to work at amazon audible, because I interned
    their this summer, and it was so much fun. </p>
