    <p>One of my hobbies is speaking <strong>Chinese</strong>. I've been learning the language for about two years now. I practice in my free time by going over flash cards outside of class,
        and speaking with other people that I know that speak the language. I also enjoy watching Chinese dramas as well. </p>
    <p>In June 2018, My family and I went to China. It was a amazing and unique experience, and a trip that I'll never forget.</p>
